# Bayesian Analysis Workshop

DataFest Tbilisi 2024

Welcome to the Bayesian Analysis workshop! This repository contains all the materials you'll need to get started.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop will introduce you to Bayesian analysis using Python. We'll cover the basics and dive into practical applications using the PyMC library. By the end of this workshop, you'll be comfortable implementing Bayesian models and using them to make data-driven decisions.

## Setting Up the Environment

To run the notebooks provided in this workshop, you'll need to set up a conda environment. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
   
2. Activate the environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate bayesian-analysis
   ```
   
3. Install `graphviz`

`graphviz` is a visualization tool that PyMC uses to draw graphs. Visit the [Graphviz website](https://graphviz.org/download/) to download and install the software.

4. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   
Alternatively, you can use an IDE like PyCharm or VSCode to run the notebooks. I'll be using PyCharm in this workshop.

2.	Open the notebook 00_intro_to_bayesian_update.ipynb.
	3.	Run all the cells to make sure everything works as expected.
	4.	If you encounter any issues, ensure that all the dependencies are installed and that graphviz is correctly set up.
